# AI Jobs Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques using Python's data science ecosystem. It focuses on exploring AI job listings data through cleaning, analysis, and visual representation using matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- `ai_jobs.csv` - Original dataset
- `ai_jobs_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned dataset
- `data_cleaning.py` - Data preprocessing and cleaning operations
- `data_analysis.py` - Data analysis operations
- `visualizations.py` - Data visualization using matplotlib

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization and plotting

## Visualizations Included

1. **Average Salary by Country** - Bar chart showing salary distribution across countries
2. **Top 10 Job Titles** - Bar chart of most common AI job positions
3. **Top 10 Countries** - Bar chart showing countries with most AI job listings
4. **Experience Level Distribution** - Pie chart displaying the breakdown of experience levels
5. **Salary by Experience Level** - Box plot comparing salary ranges across experience levels
6. **Salary Trends Over Time** - Scatter plot with trend line showing salary evolution

## Educational Purpose

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**: This project was created purely for educational purposes to develop and demonstrate skills in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
- Data analysis using NumPy and Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Working with CSV datasets and data manipulation

**The dataset used in this project is not verified for accuracy and should not be considered reliable for real-world decisions or professional insights.** The data quality is limited and may contain synthetic or inaccurate information. The primary goal of this project is to learn and practice technical skills in data science workflows, not to provide accurate market analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Project

1. Clean the data:

```bash
python data_cleaning.py
```

2. Analyze the data:

```bash
python data_analysis.py
```

3. Generate visualizations:

```bash
python visualizations.py
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding data cleaning workflows and handling missing values
- Data type conversions and standardization
- Removing duplicates and handling outliers
- Creating meaningful visualizations from raw data
- Using matplotlib for various chart types (bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots)
- Grouping and aggregating data with pandas
- Statistical analysis and data exploration techniques
